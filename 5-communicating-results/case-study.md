## Context

The city of Brussels is considering a new motto:

- **"The melting pot of Europe"**

As part of their decision process they hired your data science team to help answer the question:

- _Does this motto actually describe Brussels?_

They have given you access to some [demographics data from Brussels](https://brussels-diversity.jetpack.ai/) and are expecting your team to return with one of these 3 answers:

1. **_Yes_**, based on the data provided we believe Brussels can be described as the melting pot of europe because \_\_\_.
2. **_No_**, based on the data provided we do not believe Brussels can be described as the melting pot of europe because \_\_\_.
3. **_Maybe_**, we could not tell based on the data you provided us because \_\_\_. Further research might include \_\_\_.

You will have 30 minutes to present and discuss with a panel of 3 elected officials who have the final decision on whether or not to adopt the new motto. The panel members are (in no particular order):
