- What are their backgrounds?

  - How can you help them understand what you have to say?

- What are their constraints?

  - How can you make sure your message is actionable for them?

## Defining your Message

- Summarize on a note card what you want to communicate.

- Share what you learned, not how you learned it.

- Tell stories, not facts.

  - Data and analysis results are not a story!

- Plan for validation.

  - How can you know if your message was understood?

---

## Presenting your Story

- You have communicated what your audience understood.

  - Not what you wanted to say!

- Choose a medium that matches your audience and context.

- Plan for questions and a discussion.

  - How else can you know what they understood?
