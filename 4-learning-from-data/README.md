2. Workshop objectives

3. _Correct_ vs. _Supported_

4. Tie into the Big Picture

5. The risks of not being impartial

6. Generating Knowledge from data

7. Where algorithms fit

8. A Case Study

   - _small group exercise_

9. Discussion

10. Next Steps

---

## Check-Ins

1. What is your project's objective?

1. What kind of data has your group found for your project?

1. What do you trust and not trust about your data?

---

## Workshop Objectives

- A prediction being _correct_ and being _supported_ are not the same.

- Where does data analysis fit in the big picture?

- How not being impartial can ruin your analysis.

- The role of algorithms in data analysis.

---

## A Statement Can Be ...

???

Use covid tests as an example.

## The Big Picture

## Risks of not being Impartial

Risks include:

- Accidentally finding the answer you wanted

- Not noticing when the data says something unexpected

- Limiting your exploration

Ways to Avoid

- _Trying_ to prove yourself wrong

- _Trying_ to prove the opposite of your assumption

- Following a rigorous methodology ...

---

## Data --> Knowledge

1. Formulate specific predictions relevant to your overall objective.

2. Plan how to validate your analysis results.

3. Run the analysis.

4. Validate the results of your analysis.

   - No conclusion is still a result!

5. Relate your results back to your overall objective.

6. Return to step 1.

## What About Algorithms?

- Help you find patterns in data, different algorithms for different types of pattern.

- Must be the right approach for your data + questions.

- Introduce complexity to your analysis, they must help more than they hurt.

- Sometimes you don't need them.

- They do not eliminate bias or priors.

- They cannot think for you!

---

## Small-Group Discussion

- In small groups, go through the [discussion questions](./discussion-questions.md)

---

## Group Stand-ups & Discussion

1. Each group presents. (_2 minutes per group, practice being succinct!_)

2. Full-group discussion

---

## Next Steps

Analyze your data!
